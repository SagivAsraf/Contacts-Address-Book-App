# Contacts-Address-Book-App
A system that manage an contacts address book,using MVC design pattern.
In working on this project, I try to write it as most modular as I can, by using interfaces and MVC design pattern.
App.java is the main class in this projects.

When you run the app, you see 2 forms:
form 1 is java swing
form 2 is javaFx -> you can see the difference in the view design , and the code of course.

The app has the following features:
1. Create new contact
2. Update an existing contact
3. Browse between the contacts
4. Export the contacts book to a file -> txt file, obj file and byte file.
5. Sort your contacts book by first/last name, phone number in ascending/descending order

And more!
Enjoy :)
